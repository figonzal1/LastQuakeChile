Complete details on each type of Personal Data collected are provided in the dedicated sections of

Personal Data may be freely provided by the User, or, in case of Usage Data, collected automatically
when using this Application. Unless specified otherwise, all Data requested by this Application is
mandatory and failure to provide this Data may make it impossible for this Application to provide
its services. In cases where this Application specifically states that some Data is not mandatory,
Users are free not to communicate this Data without consequences to the availability or the
functioning of the Service.

Any use of Cookies – or of other tracking tools – by this Application or by the owners of
third-party services used by this Application serves the purpose of providing the Service required
by the User, in addition to any other purposes described in the present document and in the Cookie
Policy, if available.

Users are responsible for any third-party Personal Data obtained, published or shared through this
Application and confirm that they have the third party's consent to provide the Data to the Owner.

### Mode and place of processing the Data

##### Methods of processing

The Owner takes appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure,
modification, or unauthorized destruction of the Data. The Data processing is carried out using
computers and/or IT enabled tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to
the purposes indicated. In addition to the Owner, in some cases, the Data may be accessible to
certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this Application (administration,
sales, marketing, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical
service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, communications agencies)
appointed, if necessary, as Data Processors by the Owner. The updated list of these parties may be
requested from the Owner at any time.

##### Legal basis of processing

The Owner may process Personal Data relating to Users if one of the following applies:

* Users have given their consent for one or more specific purposes. Note: Under some legislation's
  the Owner may be allowed to process Personal Data until the User objects to such processing (
  “opt-out”), without having to rely on consent or any other of the following legal bases. This,
  however, does not apply, whenever the processing of Personal Data is subject to European data
  protection law;
* Provision of Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement with the User and/or for any
  pre-contractual obligations thereof;
* Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the Owner is subject;
* Processing is related to a task that is carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of
  official authority vested in the Owner;
* Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the Owner or by a
  third party.

In any case, the Owner will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.

##### Place

The Data is processed at the Owner's operating offices and in any other places where the parties
involved in the processing are located.

Depending on the User's location, data transfers may involve transferring the User's Data to a
country other than their own. To find out more about the place of processing of such transferred
Data, Users can check the section containing details about the processing of Personal Data.

Users are also entitled to learn about the legal basis of Data transfers to a country outside the
European Union or to any international organization governed by public international law or set up
by two or more countries, such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by the Owner to
safeguard their Data.

If any such transfer takes place, Users can find out more by checking the relevant sections of this
document or inquire with the Owner using the information provided in the contact section.

##### Retention time

Personal Data shall be processed and stored for as long as required by the purpose they have been
collected for.

Therefore:

* Personal Data collected for purposes related to the performance of a contract between the Owner
  and the User shall be retained until such contract has been fully performed.
* Personal Data collected for the purposes of the Owner’s legitimate interests shall be retained as
  long as needed to fulfill such purposes. Users may find specific information regarding the
  legitimate interests pursued by the Owner within the relevant sections of this document or by
  contacting the Owner.

The Owner may be allowed to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given
consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn. Furthermore, the Owner may be
obliged to retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever required to do so for the performance
of a legal obligation or upon order of an authority.

Once the retention period expires, Personal Data shall be deleted. Therefore, the right of access,
the right to erasure, the right to rectification and the right to data portability cannot be
enforced after expiration of the retention period.

### The purposes of processing

The Data concerning the User is collected to allow the Owner to provide its Service, comply with its
legal obligations, respond to enforcement requests, protect its rights and interests (or those of
its Users or third parties), detect any malicious or fraudulent activity, as well as the following:

      for the distribution of mobile apps, provided by Google LLC or by Google Ireland Limited,
      depending on the location this Application is accessed from. By virtue of being distributed
      via this app store, Google collects usage and diagnostics data and share aggregate information
      with the Owner. Much of this information is processed on an opt-in basis. Users may opt-out of
      this analytics feature directly through their device settings. More information on how to
      manage analysis settings can be found on this page. Personal Data processed: Usage Data. Place

      a detailed explanation about the other tools used by the Owner. This Application uses
      identifiers for mobile devices and technologies similar to cookies to run the Firebase
      Analytics service. Users may opt-out of certain Firebase features through applicable device
      settings, such as the device advertising settings for mobile phones or by following the
      instructions in other Firebase related sections of this privacy policy, if available. Personal

      In-app purchases; launches; number of sessions; number of Users ; operating systems; session

      processing: United States – [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy); Ireland
      – [Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

* Personalized Ads

  Google may use the device ID from where the ad is serving to generate interest and demographic
  categories (for example, ‘sports enthusiasts’ or ‘inferred age: 18-34’). These interest and
  demographic categories will be used to serve ads better targeted to the user. Additionally, your
  app’s privacy policy may need to be updated to reflect the use of interest-based advertising
  served via the Admob SDK. Please take a moment to review your app’s privacy policies and ensure
  that they are up-to-date. Because publisher sites and laws vary across countries, we’re unable to
  suggest specific privacy policy language.
