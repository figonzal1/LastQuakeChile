# Android Architecture Clean Patterns

## Selection Notes

- Category: `foundations`
- Best fit when the request matches the trigger language in `SKILL.md` and the implementation focus
  is
  `Apply clean architecture boundaries, use cases, repositories, and lifecycle-aware presentation models in Android projects.`
- Reach for neighboring skills only after this skill has framed the main problem.

## Default Review Sequence

1. Map the request to the current Android stack, module boundaries, and minimum supported API level.
2. Inspect the existing implementation for implicit assumptions, duplicate helpers, and outdated
   patterns.
3. Apply the smallest change that improves correctness, readability, and long-term maintainability.
4. Validate the result against the relevant showcase app path and repo benchmarks.
5. Hand off adjacent work to the next specialized skill only after the core foundation is stable.

## Handoff Shortlist

- `android-modularization`
- `android-state-management`
